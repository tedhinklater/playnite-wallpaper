# playnite-wallpaper

A mix of Playnite, AutoHotKey and Rainmeter (Rainmeter not required but adds the App Launcher and Weather functionality).

# What does it do?
Effectively sets Playnite as the wallpaper below all other apps including the Taskbar and any Rainmeter skins. 
Any theme will work, but this theme is clean/not broken and has space around the edges for the Taskbar and stuff.
